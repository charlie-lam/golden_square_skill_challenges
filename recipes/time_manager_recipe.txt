Time manager Method Design Recipe

1. Describe the Problem
Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

    As a user
    So that I can manage my time
    I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can read 200 words a minute.

2. Design the Method Signature
Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects.

    time_manager method 
    (text, word_rate) string argument and word_rate arguement for reusability. 
    Should return number as words in text divided by the words/min 

3. Create Examples as Tests
Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return.

    time_manager("This is example text for this time manager method design", 200) => "0.05 minutes"
    time_manager("To myopic eyes the shower unit head resembled a cobra, poised to strike. Mistakenly he hit the cold tapâ€”in January. The shower spat icy venom. Shrieking, he leapt with mongoose agility. One hand snaked towards the tap and turned rapidly. In a second it was over. He was safe.", 200) => "0.25 minutes"
    time_manager("", 200) => Error "Please enter at least one word."    
    time_manager("Hello again this is a string", 0) => Error "Please enter more than 0 words per minute"

4. Implement the Behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
