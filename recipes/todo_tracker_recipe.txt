Todo tracker Method Design Recipe

1. Describe the Problem
Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

    As a user
    So that I can keep track of my tasks
    I want to check if a text includes the string #TODO.


2. Design the Method Signature
Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects.

    todo_tracker method
    (text) String arguemnt passed
    Based on limited user story, should return true if the text contains "#TODO" else return false. 

3. Create Examples as Tests
Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return.

    todo_tracker("") => Error "Please enter text"
    todo_tracker("This text should return false") => false
    todo_tracker("#TODO : Finish Makers") => true
    todo_tracker("This won't make sense but still pass #TODO") => true

4. Implement the Behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
