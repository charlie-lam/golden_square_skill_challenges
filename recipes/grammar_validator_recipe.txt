Grammar validator Method Design Recipe

1. Describe the Problem
Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

    As a user
    So that I can improve my grammar
    I want to verify that a text starts with a capital letter and ends with a suitable sentence-ending punctuation mark.

2. Design the Method Signature
Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects.

    grammar_validator method
    (text) string argument
    Should return true if both requirements are met otherwise false

3. Create Examples as Tests
Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return.

    grammar_validator("") => Error "Please enter text"
    grammar_validator("hello this won't work") => false
    grammar_validator("Much better grammar!") => true

4. Implement the Behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
